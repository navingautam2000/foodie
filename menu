        Chicken tikka masala is a delicious grilled chicken dish with a thick,
         creamy gravy that is unforgettable after the first bite. A tomato-yogurt
          sauce is spiced with chili, garlic, ginger, and garam masala, the ubiquitous
           Indian spice blend. The chicken is marinated overnight, grilled, and then gently 
           cooked in a slightly smoky gravy. You will want to serve this dish over basmati 
           rice with warm naan bread for soaking up the sauce.

        The most popular paneer recipe at Indian restaurants is,
         by far, palak paneer. It is a mildly flavored dish that is super healthy,
          as it is nothing more than spinach and cottage cheese (the paneer), along with
           the typical Indian spices.Thanks to the large portions of spinach and fenugreek 
        leaves included in the recipe, this dish takes on a deep green hue. 
        The cubed paneer are pan-fried first, contributing a nice texture to the dish. 
        Palak paneer gets even better when served with your favorite flatbread.

    Malai kofta (vegetable "meatballs" in a thick sauce) is the vegetarian alternative 
    to meatballs. The koftas are made with a mix of potatoes, carrots, beans, peas,
     and sweet corn, which are cooked and mashed before mixing with spices and paneer, 
     that essential blocked "cheese" that is similar to tofu in texture and a great addition 
     to any vegetarian meal. It's rather easy to find if you don't want to make it, especially
      if you shop at a natural foods market. Malai kofta goes very well with naan or jeera rice.
